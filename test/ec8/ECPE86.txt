Course Objectives
Course provides basic concepts of different types of Memories. It provides understanding of
transistor based design of Memory cell and associated circuits like sense amplifiers and decoders.
Electromagnetic compatibility of memory devices when working in high speed systems will be
introduced.
Course Content:
UNIT I
INTRODUCTION TO SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORIES AND TECHNOLOGIES:
Internal organization of memory chips, basic memory elements, memory types, trends in SRAM
and DRAM design, Non-volatile memory technologies. Radiation Effects-radiation types effecting
the memory, radiation hardening techniques (EMC).
UNIT II
SRAM AND DRAM CELL DESIGN: basic structures-NMOS static/dynamic circuits,CMOS
circuits, Cell design, Design parameters, read write operations.
UNIT III
SENSE AMPLIFIERS: Voltage and Current Sense Amplifiers; Reference VoltageGeneration;
Voltage Converters.
UNIT IV
CACHE MEMORY DESIGN: Concept of locality in space and time, interfacing
cachememory with CPU, associated problems-parasitic capacitances, critical timing paths,
