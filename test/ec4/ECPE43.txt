Course Learning Objectives
This course aims to provide students with the understanding of the different technologies
related to HDLs, construct, compile and execute Verilog HDL programs using provided
software tools. Design digital components and circuits that are testable, reusable, and
synthesizable.Students are provided with access to the CAD tools to use hardware
description language to model, analyze and design various digital circuits/systems.
